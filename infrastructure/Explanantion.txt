Write-Up for Explaining the Project in an Interview
Project Overview:

This project focuses on automating Infrastructure as Code (IaC) deployment and management using a GitOps approach. The goal is to ensure smooth deployment, updates, and maintenance of infrastructure across DEV, UAT, and PRD environments using CI/CD pipelines.

The project utilizes GitHub Actions as the CI/CD tool and integrates Terraform for IaC management. We implemented a workflow that ensures controlled and efficient infrastructure changes, while also managing version control through semantic versioning.

Folder Structure:

The repository follows a modular structure to promote reusability and better organization:

├── infrastructure/
│   ├── modules/
│   │   ├── compute/
│   │   ├── network/
│   │   └── load_balancer/

├── environments/

│   ├── uat/
│   └── prd/
infrastructure/modules: Contains reusable Terraform modules for compute, network, and load balancer resources.
environments/: Holds configuration files specific to each environment (DEV, UAT, PRD).
Pipeline Design:

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and handles the following tasks:

Push and Pull Request Triggers:

Triggered on changes to dev, uat, or main branches for respective environments.
Pull request workflows ensure code reviews and approvals before merging changes.
Deployment Steps:

Checkout Code: Pulls the repository to the runner.
Python Setup: Prepares the environment to run the semantic versioning script.
Git Tag Bumping: Automatically increments the Git tag based on the type of change (e.g., patch, minor, major).
Terraform Initialization and Execution:
Initializes Terraform.
Selects or creates the appropriate environment workspace.
Plans and applies infrastructure changes.
Optional Destroy Step: Provides the flexibility to destroy resources if required.
Notification Step:

Sends a notification upon successful deployment to keep the team informed.
Key Features and Challenges Solved:

Automation:

The pipeline eliminates manual intervention, reducing errors and speeding up deployment.
Environment Segregation:

Each environment (DEV, UAT, PRD) has a dedicated workspace in Terraform to ensure isolated infrastructure.
GitOps and Semantic Versioning:

The bump_version.py script ensures that every change to the infrastructure is versioned systematically and synchronized with the remote repository.
Team Collaboration:

The pull request workflow enforces code reviews, fostering collaboration among DevOps engineers.
Scalability:

The modular folder structure makes it easy to add or update resources without affecting existing configurations.
Tools and Technologies Used:

GitHub Actions: For automating CI/CD workflows.
Terraform: To define and manage infrastructure as code.
Python: For scripting the semantic version bump.
Git: For version control and GitOps practices.
Key Takeaways:

This project showcases:

My ability to design and implement a robust CI/CD pipeline.
Proficiency in Terraform and GitHub Actions.
Understanding of GitOps principles and semantic versioning.
Collaborative workflow setup for multi-environment deployments.
By integrating automation, modular design, and best practices, the project ensures reliable and scalable infrastructure management across all environments.
